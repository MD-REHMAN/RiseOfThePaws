The below code is not work if you just copy and paste it on the code.
The code only contais the logic. So you might have to add new variable to the code or edit some existing variables or the variable of this code accordingly.'




on Touch(){
	Isjumping = 1;
}

if(Isjumping == 1) {
	cat_y = cat_y - jumpSpeed;
	// This is the part we're we will draw jumping cats
}

if(cat_y >= obstical.getheight()) {
	Isjumping = 0;
	IsFalling = 1;
}

if(IsFalling == 1) {
	cat_y = cat_y - fallSpeed;
	// And in the part we'll draw falling cats
}


if(cat_y <= ground_y) {
	cat_y = ground_y;
	IsFalling = 0;
}
